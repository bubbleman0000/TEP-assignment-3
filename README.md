# TEP-assignment-3
16-PSK modulation assignment

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task:
You are given the following 16-PSK modulation parameters:
‚Ä¢ The bitstream to be transmitted is 1010110011011101 (16 bits).
‚Ä¢ The carrier frequency ùëìùëê
is 1 MHz.
‚Ä¢ The symbol rate ùëÖùë†
is 1 kHz.
By using MATLAB:
1. Generate the bitstream and group it into 4-bit symbols for 16-PSK modulation.
2. Map the 4-bit symbols to phase angles (0¬∞ to 360¬∞) corresponding to the 16 distinct
phases in 16-PSK.
3. Generate the modulated signal for transmission using the carrier frequency and
the phase shifts.
4. Show the truth table and plot the constellation diagram to visualize the 16-PSK
modulation.

The outptut is shown as:

Due to too compacting of wave in single unit. we decided to zoom in the carrier signal and also modulated signal by using
the following code. which the ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `target time` is represent the target time unit we trying to look at.

The following graph shows the zoomed in version of carrier signal:

And the following graphs show the zoomed in version of the modulated signal at time=1ms, 2ms, 3ms and 4ms.

And the demodulated signal waveform should looks like this:
