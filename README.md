# TEP-assignment-3
16-PSK modulation assignment


The outptut is shown as:

Due to too compacting of wave in single unit. we decided to zoom in the carrier signal and also modulated signal by using
the following code. which the target time is represent the target time unit we trying to look at.

The following graph shows the zoomed in version of carrier signal:

And the following graphs show the zoomed in version of the modulated signal at time=1ms, 2ms, 3ms and 4ms.

And the demodulated signal waveform should looks like this:
